# STKDE-NonStationaryBackground

<b>Abstract</b>

The advancement of technology has enabled us to collect vast quantities of spatiotemporal data at rapidly increasing rate through sensor systems, automated geocoding abilities and social media platforms. Exploratory space-time data analysis approaches allow us to detect patterns that facilitate the formation of hypotheses about their driving processes. However, it is important to recognize that patterns of social phenomena emerge from an underlying population, which has to be accounted for in order to extract meaningful information from the data. This research challenges a key assumption of many prominent exploratory methods that account for a spatially varying population, which is that population is static through time. We put forward the method of adaptive kernel density estimation by accounting for spatially and temporally inhomogeneous background populations (ST-IB) and assess the benefit of considering the temporal dimension by comparing ST-IB to its purely spatial counterpart. For both approaches, we delineate clusters and compare odds ratios across a variety of parameter configurations, as well as their significance. We illustrate the benefits of our methodology using a case study of dengue fever in Cali, Colombia during the epidemic of 2010 â€“ 2011. The results show that adding the temporal dimension to our analysis does indeed improve our ability to delineate significant clusters for certain parameter configurations. Our study addresses an urgent issue in the spatial analysis literature, supplements statistical approaches, furnishes visualization tools for exploratory data analysis, and makes use of the increased availability of population data at high spatial and temporal resolutions.

<b>Data and codes availability statement</b>

The dengue fever data cannot be made publicly available as we do not have an agreement with the provider to share it.  In this repository, we include a simulated mock dataset, which serves as a detailed description of content and format of the dengue fever data. It should be sufficient for applying ST-IB to other spatiotemporal point datasets. All other data and codes used in this study are available here.
